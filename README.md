# SQL-Monitoring

## **Overview**
The **SQL-Monitoring** repository contains a set of SQL scripts designed to monitor, collect, and analyze SQL Server performance metrics. These scripts help database administrators (DBAs) identify resource bottlenecks, optimize query performance, and maintain a healthy SQL Server environment.

The solution includes:
- **Performance Metrics Collection**: Tracks CPU, memory, disk I/O, and query performance.
- **Monthly Summarization**: Aggregates raw data for long-term trend analysis.
- **Query Analysis**: Identifies the most resource-intensive queries.
- **Data Maintenance**: Ensures efficient storage by pruning older records.

---

## **Key Features**

### **Comprehensive Metrics**:
- Tracks real-time performance for CPU usage, wait statistics, memory, and disk I/O.
- Captures detailed query performance metrics for advanced analysis.

### **Monthly Summarization**:
- Aggregates data into summarized tables for easier reporting and trend analysis.

### **Top Queries Analysis**:
- Identifies the 10 most resource-intensive queries each month, including execution count and average CPU usage.

### **Automated Maintenance**:
- Deletes old records to manage table size and improve query performance.

### **Customizable Database**:
- By default, uses a database named **Blitz**, but can be adapted for any database.

## **Repository Contents**

1. **`blitzTablestocreate.sql`**  
   - **Purpose**: Creates the schema required for monitoring SQL Server performance.  
   - **Tables Included**:
     - `JobStepMetrics`: Stores raw performance data.
     - `MonthlyJobMetrics`: Stores monthly summaries of performance metrics.
     - `MonthlyWorstQueries`: Tracks the 10 most resource-intensive queries for each month.
     - `JobExecutionHistory` *(optional)*: Logs SQL Agent job execution history.

2. **`ServerPerformanceScripts.sql`**  
   - **Purpose**: Collects, summarizes, and prunes performance metrics.  
   - **Key Functions**:
     - Collects raw performance data into `JobStepMetrics`.
     - Aggregates data into `MonthlyJobMetrics`.
     - Extracts the top 10 queries into `MonthlyWorstQueries`.
     - Prunes data older than one month.

3. **`PerformanceAnalysisQueries.sql`**  
   - **Purpose**: Provides detailed analysis of collected performance metrics, including job step summaries, query performance, and trends.  
   - **Designed for**: Ad-hoc execution in SQL Server Management Studio.
  
4. **`QueryAnalysisJobStepMetrics.sql`**  
    - **Purpose**: Provides analysis of the `JobStepMetrics` table to detect trends, anomalies, and performance bottlenecks.  
    - **Designated for**: Analyzing CPU, memory, and disk performance metrics captured from SQL Server jobs.

5. **`ServerPerformanceScripts.sql`**  
    - **Purpose**: Collects and summarizes server performance metrics, including CPU, memory, disk I/O, and wait statistics.  
    - **Designated for**: Setting up automated performance monitoring in SQL Server environments.

6. **`Top10MonthlyWorstQueries.sql`**  
    - **Purpose**: Identifies the top 10 resource-intensive queries each month, helping DBAs focus on optimizing high-impact SQL workloads.  
    - **Designated for**: Monthly query performance analysis.

7. **`TopQueriesperDatabase.sql`**  
    - **Purpose**: Highlights the most resource-intensive queries grouped by database, providing database-specific insights into query performance.  
    - **Designated for**: Monitoring and improving query performance per database.
8. **`TotalIOMetricsxDatabase.sql`**: Analyzes disk I/O metrics to identify storage performance bottlenecks.
     - **Purpose** :
       Analyzes disk I/O metrics, including read/write stalls and total I/O wait times, to identify potential bottlenecks.
    - **Designated for**
       Tracking and optimizing database storage performance.

## **How to Use**

### **Step 1: Setup**
- Run `blitzTablestocreate.sql` in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to create the necessary tables.
- Use the default **Blitz** database or modify the script to use a different database.

### **Step 2: Create Monitoring Jobs**
- Use the queries from `ServerPerformanceScripts.sql` to create SQL Server Agent jobs.
- Schedule jobs to:
  - Collect raw performance metrics (daily).
  - Summarize monthly metrics (end of the month).
  - Prune old data (monthly maintenance).

### **Step 3: Analyze Data**
- Use the `MonthlyJobMetrics` table for long-term performance trends.
- Use the `MonthlyWorstQueries` table to identify and optimize high-impact queries.
- Export summarized data for visualization in tools like Power BI or Excel.
